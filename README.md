# virtualdj-customizations
A Repository to store my custom controller mappings, Pads and other Atomix Virtual DJ 8.5 randomness

Index: 

  Mappers\Akai APC Mini - Beatjumps.xml 
          - A Custom Map for the Akai APC Mini Controller. This map has all Beatjumps from 1 Beat to 32 Bars. Stem control. Low/Mid/Hi Kill Buttons. and more.


  Mappers\Pioneer DDJ-SB2 - 2021.xml
          - A Custom Map for the DDJ-SB2. The Right Trim knob on my controller no longer works so this maps the gain control onto the filter knobs and does some other tricks.
        
  Pads\EDM HOTCUES.xml
          - A Custom Pad for setting up basic intro and outro hotcues for EDM style music ( but really for UKBounce ). The Buttons do the following
          Get First Beat - Zooms into the first beat of the track.
          Set Cues - Deletes any existing cues (1-4). Sets the firstbeat and beatgrid to the current position. Sets hotcue 1-4 every 16 bars
          Goto End - Goes to the end of the track based on the 100% song position. ( Note this is not always 64 beats from the end if there is silence at the end)
          Set End Cues - Deletes any existing cues (5-8). Sets new cues in a descending pattern with cue 8 being set 16 bars before the current position and so on
          
          Note on usage - After using Goto End you more than likely will have to manually find the end of the last 16 bar loop
